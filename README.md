* Created a ML based tool that predicts flight prices using engineered elements such as Departure Time and Date of Journey

Prices can fluctuate on minute basis and missing the right booking time can lead to big losses. We will be making use of dataset shared by: https://www.kaggle.com/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh
Size of training set: 10683 records
